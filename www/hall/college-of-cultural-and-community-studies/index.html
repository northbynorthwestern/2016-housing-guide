              <h3>2303 Sheridan Road</h3>
              <p class="body-text reduced-width padding-top">As the smallest and oldest residential college on campus, the College of Cultural and Community Studies (CCS) boasts eclectic, vaguely Ikea-inspired interior design, close-knit community and collective interest in cultural exploration, on campus and beyond. Although located on North Campus, CCS is home to students of diverse majors and backgrounds. Regular firesides and excursions into cultural neighborhoods like Pilsen and Argyle connect residents to Faculty Fellows and Master Staff, while quirky traditions like Secret Satan – where residents steal each others’ clothes before Halloween – and Service Auction – where residents sell their goods, services, companionship and more for charity – bring together residents for inter-RC fun and festivities. </p>

                    <p class="body-text quote padding-top">&ldquo;Living in CCS has been an amazing experience and I would not have changed any part of it. CCS is a great place where you can explore who you are as well as who you are becoming. It is a warm and welcoming community that is immensely supportive of people as they transition into college life. Most of my favorite memories of freshman year either took place in my res college or involved the people who live there with me. Whether attending football games, LGBTQA inclusion talks or family dinners in the CCS room, I can always count on my fellow CCSers to be by my side.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="quote-attr">Sydney Marcus, McCormick freshman</p>
          
                    <p class="body-text quote padding-top">&ldquo;CCS has a really nice and close-knit community because it has so few residents. You will definitely get to know the people you live with if you attend events and spend time in the lounge. There are lots of opportunities to socialize, but it&#39;s also pretty quiet and there&#39;s usually nothing too crazy going on, so you always have a nice, relaxed place to come back to at the end of the day.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="quote-attr">Lauren Ché Anderson Justice, Weinberg freshman</p>
          
                    <p class="body-text quote padding-top">&ldquo;I love living in CCS because we&#39;re more like a family than just a dorm. Even though we are the smallest res college, we have a wide range of people from different backgrounds and with varying interests. And you&#39;re sure to find someone that matches yours, whether you wanna go out at night or stay in and play board games! Our facilities, bathrooms, rooms, and lounges are wonderful and everything certainly has a chic, but homey feel!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="quote-attr">Ashley Antony, Weinberg freshman</p>
          
                    <p class="body-text quote padding-top">&ldquo;We have tons of washers and dryers compared to the number of students living here, especially compared to the bigger dorms like Bobb or Elder. Since it’s such a small dorm, you get a lot of personal amenities.
 The community is really good. Everyone is really supportive. People hang out in the lounge.  We hang out on weekends or weeknights.  People like to do IM’s.  It’s not the only thing people do with their time, but for most of the people who live there, it’s a large part of their time. They enjoy engaging with other people in the community.
&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="quote-attr">Peter Hosbein, McCormick freshman</p>
          
                    <p class="body-text quote padding-top">&ldquo;We’re really small, so both last year and this year, we got the opportunity to really get to know everyone on at least some basic level, which I feel like most of the other dorms don’t get to do. We have a very chill and welcoming vibe to the whole building.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="quote-attr">Daniella Lumpkin, Weinberg sophomore</p>
          
                    <p class="body-text quote padding-top">&ldquo;It’s a very small tight-knit community and it’s really well-located.  It’s close to Tech, it’s close to the gym, it’s close to food.
 It’s really far away from downtown Evanston. Most of the restaurants are on the end of the campus, so if I want to do some shopping...it’s kind of displaced from the city of Evanston.

                    <p class="body-text quote padding-top">&ldquo;I think it’s a really good place if you’re interested in having a group of people who want to be really involved in their community and are interested in finding a community within the residential experience. I think CCS is an underrated place to do that.
&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="quote-attr">Sydni White, SESP sophomore</p>
          
                    <p class="body-text quote padding-top">&ldquo;I think CCS is a very tight-knit community.  There are a lot of interesting people.  I can always come to the lounge and I’ll see someone that I know, someone studying, someone playing video games.  They are the epitome of what an RC should be.
&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="quote-attr">John Franklin, McCormick and Bienen sophomore</p>
          
                    <p class="body-text quote padding-top">&ldquo;I think it&#39;s a great and very welcoming community. I lived there my freshman and sophomore years and was pretty involved and now it&#39;s a great place to non-res. The facilities are pretty nice, and its location, as an engineer, you can&#39;t beat it.  Now I use it as a place to study, especially since Mudd is closed.
